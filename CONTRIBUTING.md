## **File naming conventions üìÅ**
- Give unique name for your game that don't exist already. 
* Folder naming convention
    - ```Game_Name```  ex.  ```Tilting_Maze```,```Rock_Paper_Scissors``` (first letter should be capital and if you need space use underscore **_** )      
* files in the folder 
    - Main html file should be named as **index.html** , not something else like ```Tilting_Maze.html```(Preferred)
    - Game files - ```index.html``` , ```script.js``` , ```style.css```(not stictly to follow this but you should have separate file for each kind)
    - It is preferred if the main html file is directly added to the main folder of you game like ```Tilting_Maze/index.html``` along with other files like **style.css**, **script.js**
    - you can have other folders if you are having assets for your game 
    - Create```README.md``` for your Game using this [TEMPLATE](../Games/FOLDER_README_TEMPLATE.md).Although, it is not compulsory to follow this README template ,you can use your own *README* template whichever you prefer, to explain functionality and code of your Game
* naming convention for the screenshot you will add in ```assets/images```
    - Remember preview image should be in ```assets/images``` and not in main folder of Game itself.
    - Name of image should be same as your Game name
    - ex. ```Tilting_Maze.jpeg``` or .jpg or .png any of the image format, but don't add image format in the name itself , it is self-assigned to a image, you don't need to add it manually, otherwise it becomes ```Tilting_Maze.jpeg.jpeg```
    - There should be only one ScreenShot of the game in ```assets/images``` and that too with same name as the Game (Exactly Same).
* Note:-All Other data except the ScreenShot of your Game, should be in it's main folder , don't add it to other folders of the project.

## Add Game to assets/js/gamesData.json

* This is to Show your game on the main Website
   - Go to the end of gamesData.json and add :
   - **,**
         " **No.** ":{
            "gameTitle" : " **Title** ",
            "gameUrl": " **Main Folder** ",
            "thumbnailUrl":" **Preview Image** " 
         }
   - **No.**: Number for your Game , it should be the next number with respect to the file. eg: if the last no. in file at present is *625* you should put *626* at the place of **No.**
   - **Title:** this is the title for your game that will be shown on the website, if your game name is ```Super_Mario_Game``` ,put Title as ```Super Mario Game```
   - **Main Folder :** This is the reference to *index.html* 
      - if your index.html is directly in main game folder ,put the main folder name eg: ```Super_Mario_Game```
      - if your index.html is in subfolder , give path to it 
      eg: ```Super_Mario_Game/public``` (assuming index.html is in public folder of Super_Mario_Game folder)
      - if your main html file's name is not index.html , you need to specify the main html file also. eg:```Super_Mario_Game/mario.html``` or if in sub folder ```Super_Mario_Game/public/mario.html```
   - **Preview Image:** This is the image that will be shown as preview for your game , here you provide the name of the image that you added to **assets/images** folder, along with format type. Eg. ```Super_Mario_Game.png``` or ```Super_Mario_Game.jpg``` or with any other format.

**Note:-** 
   
   -  Do not modify anything else in the rest of the file, you only need to add your game in the end of the file. 
   - Don't forget to add the comma for new entry (already give in above sample but this is a reminder as one might miss it to see in the sample)
